git checkout master # go to master branch
git pull origin master # get the latest master
git checkout -b my_branch_name # branch out from master

then after i am done with my coding and have committed everything, on my own branch:

git checkout -b my_branch_name_v2 # just to make sure I do not destroy my original branch by a mistake
git checkout master
git pull origin master
git checkout my_branch_name_v2
git rebase -i master # rebase the changes on master

then resolve any conflicts that show up here. once done then:

git push origin my_branch_name_v2
